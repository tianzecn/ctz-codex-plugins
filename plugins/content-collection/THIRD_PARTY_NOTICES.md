- Upstream: https://github.com/wshuyi/x-article-publisher-skill
- Referenced docs: https://github.com/wshuyi/x-article-publisher-skill/blob/main/README_CN.md
- License: MIT (copyright notice: wshuyi)
- Local copy of license: `licenses/wshuyi-x-article-publisher-skill-LICENSE.txt`
- Usage in this repo:
  - Workflow and X Articles editor automation references
  - Adapted Markdown parsing and rich-text conversion ideas now used by `yichen-x-article-draft-uploader`

## 2) JimLiu/baoyu-skills

- Upstream: https://github.com/JimLiu/baoyu-skills
- License declaration source: https://github.com/JimLiu/baoyu-skills/blob/main/README.md#license
- Repository state checked on 2026-02-11:
  - README contains `## License` and `MIT` statement
  - No top-level LICENSE file found in repository root at check time
- Local notice: `licenses/JimLiu-baoyu-skills-license-note.txt`
- Usage in this repo:
  - Referenced workflow/experience for Claude skills packaging and usage patterns

## 3) zhuyansen/wx-favorites-report

- Upstream: https://github.com/zhuyansen/wx-favorites-report
- Author: zhuyansen
- License: MIT
- Usage in this repo (`yichen-wechat-local-vault`):
  - Frida hook method for intercepting `CCKeyDerivationPBKDF` (Apple CommonCrypto PBKDF2) to extract SQLCipher encryption keys at runtime
  - SQLCipher 4 page-level decryption logic (AES-256-CBC, page_size=4096, reserve=80)
  - The approach of codesign-bypass to remove Hardened Runtime for frida injection
- What was adapted:
  - The frida JS hook script structure was adapted from the original project's key extraction methodology
  - The database decryption function was implemented based on the documented decryption parameters
  - The overall workflow (codesign → frida spawn → hook → capture keys → match to DB files) follows the same approach

## 4) wechat-article/wechat-article-exporter

- Upstream: https://github.com/wechat-article/wechat-article-exporter
- License: MIT
- Usage in this repo (`yichen-wechat-mp-batch-exporter`):
  - Referenced workflow for WeChat Official Account search, history sync, multi-format export, and enhanced metric/comment export.
  - The skill points users to their own local or hosted `wechat-article-exporter` instance instead of vendoring upstream code.
- What was copied:
  - No upstream source code is vendored in this repository.
  - The public skill only includes local wrapper scripts, runbooks, output schemas, safety gates, and attribution links.

## 5) wechat-article/wxdown-service

- Upstream: https://github.com/wechat-article/wxdown-service
- Documentation: https://docs.mptext.top/advanced/wxdown-service
- License: MIT, according to the upstream documentation footer.
- Usage in this repo (`yichen-wechat-mp-batch-exporter`):
  - Referenced the credential-capture workflow needed for read counts, likes, shares, comments, and replies.
  - The skill requires explicit user confirmation before any certificate, proxy, credential, or WeChat desktop step.
- What was copied:
  - No upstream source code is vendored in this repository.
  - `start_wxdown_service.py` only starts a user-provided local checkout path and does not modify system proxy settings.

## 6) sudoHG/codex-grok-search

- Upstream: https://github.com/sudoHG/codex-grok-search
- License: MIT
- Usage in this repo (`yichen-grok-consult`):
  - Referenced the public architecture of invoking the official Grok Build CLI from Codex in an isolated non-Git workspace.
  - Reinforced the boundary that Grok should receive search tools without access to the user's current repository, browser cookies, local shell, or unrelated credentials.
- What was copied:
  - No upstream source code is vendored in this repository.
  - The MCP server, transcript verification, URL extraction, Snowflake timestamp decoder, and Codex plugin packaging are independently implemented here.

## 7) xAI Grok Build CLI

- Official documentation: https://docs.x.ai/build/overview
- Usage in this repo (`yichen-grok-consult`): external runtime dependency for native `x_search`, `web_search`, and `web_fetch`.
- What is included:
  - No Grok Build binary, xAI credential, authentication file, or xAI source code is included.
  - Users install and authenticate the CLI separately under xAI's current terms and documentation.

## 8) afar1/fieldtheory-cli

- Upstream: https://github.com/afar1/fieldtheory-cli
- License: MIT
- Local license copy: `licenses/afar1-fieldtheory-cli-LICENSE.txt`
- Usage in this repo (`yichen-social-bookmarks-exporter`):
  - Optional external runtime for syncing X bookmarks and reading the user's local Field Theory index through `ft list --json`.
  - The Skill requires a compatible build whose version contains `graphql-only` before it will export X links.
- What was copied:
  - No Field Theory source code, binary, private Query ID, Cookie, credential, or bookmark data is vendored in this repository.
  - `export_x_links.py` is an independently implemented URL-only adapter that invokes the separately installed `ft` command.
- Modification status:
  - `graphql-only` identifies a user-maintained compatibility and safety overlay, not an official upstream Field Theory release name.
  - The modified runtime is not distributed in this repository.
  - Any redistribution of a modified Field Theory build must preserve the upstream MIT copyright and license notice and must not be represented as an official upstream release.

## 9) WeComTeam/wecom-cli

- Upstream: https://github.com/WecomTeam/wecom-cli
- Package: https://www.npmjs.com/package/@wecom/cli
- License: MIT, Copyright (c) 2026 WeCom
- Usage in this repo (`yichen-wecom-operations`):
  - External runtime for owner-authorized document, todo, meeting, schedule, and contact operations.
  - The public Skill invokes a separately installed `wecom-cli`; it does not vendor upstream source or binaries.
- Local-image boundary:
  - The public Skill can use an optional external helper exposing `doc +doc_upload_image` when the user explicitly configures `WECOM_UPLOAD_HELPER`.
  - That helper capability comes from a local, unpublished extension and is not distributed by this repository or represented as an official upstream feature.

## Notes

- This repository maintains its own license (`LICENSE`) for original contributions. It is personal-learning and non-commercial only.
- The upstream projects listed above retain their original licenses and copyrights.
- Upstream licenses and notices should be preserved when redistributing derived works.
- `yichen-wechat-local-vault` is an independent implementation that adapts specific technical approaches from `wx-favorites-report`. It does not contain any code directly copied from the upstream project.
- `yichen-wechat-mp-batch-exporter` references workflows from `wechat-article-exporter` and `wxdown-service`, but does not include their source code, credentials, cached browser data, or downloaded article archives.
- `yichen-x-article-draft-uploader` references workflow and Markdown parsing ideas from `wshuyi/x-article-publisher-skill`; it stores no real credentials and writes cookies only to temporary runtime files.
- `yichen-summary` and the broader skill packaging conventions reference public Claude skill community practices, including JimLiu/baoyu-skills.
- `yichen-grok-consult` references the public isolation pattern from `sudoHG/codex-grok-search`, but includes an independently implemented MCP server and deterministic verification layer.
- `yichen-social-bookmarks-exporter` calls Field Theory as an optional external runtime; Field Theory remains under its upstream MIT License, while this repository's independently implemented adapter remains under this repository's license.
- `yichen-mac-wechat-dual-open` references public X/Twitter discussion and implements the copy + bundle-id + ad-hoc signing workflow locally.
- Do not remove this file when forking for personal study. It is the attribution record for borrowed ideas, workflows, and license notices.
