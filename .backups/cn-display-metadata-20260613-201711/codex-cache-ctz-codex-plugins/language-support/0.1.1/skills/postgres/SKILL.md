# PostgreSQL Skill

This skill is the working reference for **PostgreSQL 16, 17, and 18** (current baseline: PG16). Cross-version notes go back to PG14 where behavior changed; PG13 and earlier are end-of-life and out of scope. PG14 reaches end-of-life on 2026-11-12 — flag upgrade urgency when a user is on it.

The skill is provider-neutral: bare-metal/self-hosted, containers, and Kubernetes operators are all covered. Managed-service limitations are called out categorically ("most managed providers disable X") without naming or recommending any specific vendor.

Each topic lives in its own reference file under `references/`. SKILL.md routes a user question to the right reference; the reference contains the executable detail, version admonitions, and primary-source citations.


## Usage Workflow


When this skill is loaded, follow these steps to answer the user's question:

1. **Identify the topic.** Match the user's question against the **Routing Table** below using the keyword column. For multi-topic questions (e.g. "the locking behavior of REINDEX CONCURRENTLY") select multiple files.
2. **Load the matched reference file(s).** Use the Read tool against `references/NN-topic.md`. Do not paraphrase from memory — the reference holds the authoritative version notes and source URLs.
3. **Follow See Also.** Each reference ends with a **See Also** section linking related files. Follow it for cross-cutting questions (e.g. a VACUUM question pulls in MVCC, autovacuum, and wraparound).
4. **Answer using the file.** Lead with the direct answer or code, then version notes via admonitions, then caveats, then citation URLs.
5. **Never answer from memory alone** when a reference file exists for the topic. The references are the source of truth for this skill; the model's training data is not version-specific enough.
6. **Assume PG16 unless told otherwise.** If the user does not state a version, answer for PG16 and add a one-line note for differences on PG17/PG18. Only ask the user which version they are on if the answer materially changes across supported versions (e.g. wraparound mechanics, planner statistics behavior, archive_command vs archive_library).

> [!NOTE]
> When a Postgres question does not obviously match a single file, load these cross-cutting entry points first: `references/102-skill-cookbook.md` (symptom-driven recipes spanning multiple files), `references/22-indexes-overview.md` (index decision routing), `references/56-explain.md` (plan reading), `references/64-system-catalogs.md` (catalog introspection).


## User Response Format


Structure every answer using this skill as follows:

- **Lead with the direct answer or pattern.** If a SQL snippet or `psql` command satisfies the question, put that first.
- **Add version admonitions inline.** Use `> [!NOTE] PostgreSQL 17` for new-in-17 features, `> [!WARNING] Removed/Deprecated` for things gone (with the version they were removed in and the replacement).
- **Call out managed-service limitations categorically** when relevant. Phrase as "most managed providers disable X" — never name a specific provider.
- **End with source links.** Cite the official PostgreSQL docs pinned to the correct major version (e.g. `https://www.postgresql.org/docs/16/sql-vacuum.html`, not `/docs/current/`).
- **For longer answers**, use headers matching the reference file's section headings so the user can jump to the source.
- **For version-sensitive answers**, default to PG16 + add inline `> [!NOTE] PG17` / `> [!NOTE] PG18` deltas. Only ask the user to confirm version when the answer flips between supported majors.
- **For any performance investigation document or slow-query guide**, always include an explicit section explaining how to read EXPLAIN plans bottom-up: start at the deepest-indented leaf node (scans execute first), work upward through parents (joins, sorts, aggregates), reach the root last. Identify the first node where `actual rows` diverges 10× or more from estimated `rows` — that is the misestimate source; everything above it operates on bad cardinality.

## Versioning & Provider Neutrality


- **Target compatibility baseline:** every SQL example must run on PostgreSQL 16 unless explicitly marked otherwise.
- **Version-pin docs URLs.** Cite `https://www.postgresql.org/docs/16/...`, not `/docs/current/`. The `current` alias moves with each annual release.
- **Provider neutrality is mandatory.** Never recommend a managed provider over another. When discussing managed-service limitations, phrase categorically ("most managed providers disable untrusted PLs"), not by name.
