description: "Writes, optimizes, and debugs T-SQL queries. Explains SQL Server internals, troubleshoots performance issues, and guides database administration tasks including backup/restore, high availability, security, and index design. Use when the user asks about T-SQL syntax, SQL Server administration, query performance, stored procedures, indexes, locking, transactions, backup/restore, high availability, security, or any MSSQL-related topic — even without saying 'SQL Server' explicitly. Also trigger on terms like SSMS, tempdb, bcp, sqlcmd, MSSQL, sp_executesql, NOLOCK, columnstore, Hekaton, RCSI, param sniffing, or execution plan."

# MSSQL Server Skill

## How to use this skill

1. **Identify the topic** using the routing table below (keyword → file mapping).
2. **Read the relevant reference file(s).** Never answer from memory alone when a reference file covers the topic.
3. **Cross-cutting questions** — identify ALL matching rows and read each file. Check "See Also" sections for additional files.
4. **Ambiguous keywords** — read the "Disambiguation" column. When in doubt, load both files.
5. **Response format:** Lead with code/pattern, follow with caveats in admonition blocks, end with source links.

## Quick Examples

    -- Basic filtered query with pagination
    SELECT CustomerName, Email
    FROM Customer
    WHERE Status = 'Active'
    ORDER BY CustomerName
    OFFSET 0 ROWS FETCH NEXT 25 ROWS ONLY;

    -- Create a covering index
    CREATE NONCLUSTERED INDEX IX_Customer_Status
    ON Customer(Status) INCLUDE (CustomerName, Email);
